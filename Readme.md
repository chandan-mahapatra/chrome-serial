#How to use
Clone this repository somewhere. Follow
[Step 5](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/first_app#five) for getting
Chrome set up for apps. Load this repository as your app.

Read the comments in the files. Here are what they are:

- `Readme.md`: This file.
- `background.js`: The javascript that launches the app.
- `fetlab-128.png`: Icon.
- `fetlab-16.png`: Icon.
- `jquery-3.1.1.min.js`: A local copy of jQuery.
- `manifest.json`: Information that tells Chrome how to run the app.
- `serial_display.js`: Most of the code is here, and is where you
	should add your code.
- `window.html`: This is the actual HTML for the app. Modify it to
	your heart's content.
